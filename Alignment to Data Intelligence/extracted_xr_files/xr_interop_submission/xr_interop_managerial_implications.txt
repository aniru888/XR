1) Run middleware adapter pilots to reduce vendor lock-in and shorten integration timelines.
2) Engage with standards bodies such as Khronos and Metaverse Standards Forum to drive OpenXR extensions and anchoring formats.
3) Add an interoperability scorecard for procurement evaluating API openness, SDK maturity, and integration tooling.
4) Prioritize security-by-design for XR endpoints; include identity mapping and encrypted telemetry in pilots.
5) Invest in edge compute and adaptive streaming to meet real-time latency requirements.
6) Develop an 'Interop Playbook' (connectors, schema mappings, test harnesses) and train integration engineers.
